## üìö Lessons Learned

One of the most exciting challenges was implementing the **DotPortrait.tsx**:
- It dynamically maps an image's silhouette into pixelated dots, which can be manipulated to create various effects.
- This implementation opened doors to experimenting with different **transformations and animations**, enhancing user interactivity.

## üöÄ Future Scope

As with any creative project, there‚Äôs always room for improvement:

- **Fireflies Animation**:
  - Connect the homepage fireflies to the DotPortrait for a seamless scroll-based transition.

- **Project Section**:
  - Enhance the user interface for better visual clarity and navigation.

- **Contact Form**:
  - Implement a robust backend to enable users to send messages directly through the website.
